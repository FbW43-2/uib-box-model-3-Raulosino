            <h1 class="main_header">Amsterdam</h1>
            <p>Amsterdam has a long and eventful history. The origins of the city lie in the 12th century, when
                fishermen living along
                the banks of the River Amstel built a bridge across the waterway near the IJ, which at the time was a
                large saltwater
                inlet. Wooden locks under the bridge served as a dam protecting the village from the rising IJ waters,
                which often
                flooded the early settlement. The mouth of the river Amstel, where the Damrak is now, formed a natural
                harbor, which
                became important for trading-exchange from the larger koggeships into the smaller ships that sailed the
                merchandise
                deeper into the hinterland.</p>

            <aside>
                <p>Amsterdam has officially only been the capital of The Netherlands since 1983. Before that everyone
                    saw Amsterdam as the
                    capital, but it wasn’t official.
                </p>
            </aside>

            <p>There are 1281 bridges in Amsterdam, 80 can be found within the canal ring. The most famous bridge is the
                Magere Brug or
                Skinny Bridge. When you’re standing on the corner of the Reguliersgracht and Herengracht you can see 15
                bridges at the
                same time. You do have to stand on the side of the non-even numbers and count the bridge where you’re
                standing on as
                well.</p>

            <p>Most canal houses are very small at the entrance, the reason for this is that they only had to pay taxes
                for the size of
                the facade of the house. That’s why everyone built high and long houses. You can find the smallest
                facade in the world
                at Het Singel 7. It is only 1 meter wide and barely wider than the front door. As the house goes back it
                rapidly
                increases in width</p>

            <p>There are more than 300 coffee shops in Amsterdam. In coffee shops, you can buy up to 5 grams of soft
                drugs. Soft
                drugs are not legal in The Netherlands but tolerated. If you buy weed from a street dealer it’s illegal
                as you are only
                allowed to buy soft drugs at coffee shops. All hard drugs are illegal.</br></br></p>
